## About

`opject` is a specification and implementation for passing objects through the network.

An `object` is a self-contained piece of code.

The passing of the object through the network is obtained in 2 steps:

+ a registered object is requested by the `opject client` from the `opject server`;
+ the `opject client` instantiates or runs in a virtual machine the received object.

`opject` has clients for

+ `NodeJS`
+ `Python`

The `opject server` can serve any kind of object. However, depending on the preferred language, a specific `opject server` can be used for

+ `NodeJS`
+ `Python`
